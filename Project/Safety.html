<h2>Safety Alerts</h2>
<p>
Safety is a major aspect in any construction site, as such there
are many safety protocalls to follow to ensure the welbeing of any
person on site.
</p>

<div class="table">

<h3>Vehicle collision 1/1/2017</h3>
<p>
Serious injuries or fatalities occur in workplaces
because people are struck by vehicles such
as cars, vans, trucks or buses or mobile work
equipment such as industrial trucks (e.g. forklifts
or telehandlers). The most effective way to reduce
the risk of a person being hit by moving vehicles is
to have a system of work which effectively keeps
pedestrians and vehicles apart.
The main purpose of high visibility clothing is to make
the wearer stand out from the background so they
can be seen more easily, particularly by drivers of
vehicles and mobile work equipment, in any light or weather
conditions. This reduces the risk of incidents occurring in
potentially dangerous situations.
</p>

<h3>Safety Footware 1/4/2017</h3>
<p>
When working on a construction site, any person must wear
hard-capped boots to prevent injuring/breaking the persons toes.
The Health and Safety Authority has been advised of a voluntary
product recall of the following safety footwear under the brand
Shoes for Crews.
</p>
<p>
Products: Alaskan II/Alaskan 2; Aramis (black and white);
Colt Light/Lite, Defense; Guard; Luigi Light/Lite (black and white);
Mario Light/Lite (black and white); Portos (black and white);
Triston (black and white); Velocity II/Velocity 2;
Warrior Light/Lite.
</p>

<h3>Scaffolding 1/4/2017</h3>
<p>
Any scaffolding equipment, including scaffolding boards, particularly if they have been
in storage for a period of time, must not be used unless inspected by a competent
person and deemed fit for purpose. It is vital that all scaffold boards are checked
regularly thereafter for damage, rot or any other feature which may reduce the strength
of the board.
</p>
<p>
It is a legal requirement that all equipment used for working at heights in
construction is inspected by a competent person at least every seven days and records
of these inspections kept. BS 2482 provides guidance and limits on the acceptability of
defects in scaffold boards. Any board which fails one or more of the inspection criteria
in BS2482 must be destroyed.
